================
a small quick presentation I put together for a class of mine that was mostly computer science majors.
I kept it simple as the teacher was not a computer science teacher.
I feel like sharing it to see if it is liked or otherwise.

Thanks to impress.js which allowed me to create a beautiful presentation very quickly.
